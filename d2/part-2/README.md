# CSC301 Deliverable 2 Part 2 -- Readme

# Sickkids Project Team #23


## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective

 Uroflow is an Android/iOS mobile app that allows patients to remotely send audio recordings of urinary voids to the hospital, where it will be received by doctors and analyzed. 

 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?

 Currently, patients use medical equipment known as a uroflowmeter to produce graphs outlining their ability to empty their bladder. This equipment can be expensive and is not widely available outside of urologist offices and hospitals. To increase accessibility and reduce the cost of equipment, the Urology department at SickKids is attempting to develop technology that will allow the diagnosis of urinary voiding conditions without a visit to the hospital.

 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

 This product will reduce the patientâ€™s frequency of visits to the hospital. For patients living in remote areas, this will be a very convenient alternative. There is potential for significant patient and healthcare system cost savings.

## Instructions


For now, there are two methods you can access our app using your phone: 
1. The non-technical way: 
    * Download Expo Client App from App Store/Google Play 
        https://expo.io/tools#client
    * Open the app, log in to Expo using this account: 
        * username: falanke
        * password: 0192837465

      This is because of some iOS limitations from Apple, you will have to use a publisher account to view the app demo. 
    * In the profile tab, you should be able to see a published project called **uroflow**. Now you can click on it and view the app demo. 

2. The technical way (This is a back-up plan if method 1 does not work): 
    * Go to https://github.com/csc301-fall-2019/team-project-sickkids-team 
    * Clone the repo (master branch) to your computer.
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't. 
    * Cd into sickkids_uroflow folder.
    * Execute `npm install`.
    * After installation is finished, execute `npm start`
    * You should see a webpage on http://localhost:19002/ automatically pops up, once the page is loaded completely, you should see a QR code on the down-left side. 
    * Download Expo Client App from App Store/Google Play 
        https://expo.io/tools#client
    * After you have finished downloading the Expo app, scan the QR code in the webpage using your phone's native camera. 
    * You should see the expo's prompt on your phone which takes you to the expo app, and you will be able to view the app demo.
