### Feedback

#### Product
Q3 could be answered with more details. How much time is it going to save? How much is it going to cut down the cost? 
Q4 answered extremely well. The chart is really helpful.
User stories 1 and 2, and 3 are basically the same feature. However 3 has an extra component of "seeing the history" but it is poorly worded because why does the person care about the hospital database? 
User story 5 can be broken down into more features, each describing exactly what relationship the researcher wants to study. 
The acceptance criteria includes details about user stories that the user stories should have themselves. Acceptance criteria does not match the user stories.


### Process
The artifacts section should be more detailed. 
Conflict resolution is shallow and does not cover many cases. For example what if a member does not attend the meetings? 
You definitely need to go into more details here.
Good description of weaknesses and strenghts.


### Overall Quality
No grammatical or formatting mistakes.
